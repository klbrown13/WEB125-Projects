            The Town of Topsail Beach offers vacationers a variety of activities during
            their stay. We have a beautiful beach in which vacationers can enjoy sunbathing,
            swimming, surfing, fishing or whatever their favorite beach activity may
            be. In adddition to the beach, we have a beautiful soundfront with access
            to the Intercoastal Waterway and nearby Lea Island.

            The Town's Marina provides boaters with all the accomodations necessary
            for their water activities. For those that prefer to stay on land, Serenity
            Point offers beachgoers fantastic views of the sound and waterway. The
            origins of Topsail Beach as a small coastal fishing town is evident at
            the Jolly Roger Fishing Pier, where king mackerel fisherman demonstrate
            their fishing skills at the very end of the pier or spot fisherman stand
            shoulder to shoulder in the fall.
